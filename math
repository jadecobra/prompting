How to generate an algebraic template
Q: A zoo charged $12 per adult ticket and allows children under 5 to enter for free.
A family of 4 adults and 2 children under 5 visit the zoo.
What is the total cost for the family to enter?
Qt: At a zoo, each adult ticket costs $A and children under 5 can enter for free.
If a family of B adults and C children under 5 visit the zoo, what is the total cost for the family to enter?
Mapping: {A: 12, B: 4, C: 2}

Q: A store sells shoes at $60 per pair and socks at $8 per pair.
If a customer buys 2 pairs of shoes and 3 pairs of socks,
What is the total cost of the purchase?
Qt: At a store, shoes cost $A per pair and socks cost $B per pair.
If a customer buys C pairs of shoes and D pairs of socks,
What is the total cost of the purchase?
Mapping: {A: 60, B: 8, C: 2, D: 3}

If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids,
how much would it cost for the group of eat?

Algebraic statement
Qt: At a zoo, each adult ticket costs $A and children under 5 can enter for free.
If a family of B adults and C children under 5 visit the zoo, What is the total cost for the family to enter?
Mapping: {A: 12, B: 4, C: 2}

Write a mathematical equation and generate the answer format start with `Answer =`

Answer = A \* B

Qt: At a store, shoes cost $A per pair and socks cost $B per pair.
If a customer buys C pairs of shoes and D pairs of socks, What is the total cost of the purchase?
Mapping: {A: 60, B: 8, C: 2, D: 3}

Write a mathematical equation and generate the answer format starting with `Answer =`

Answer = A _ C + B _ D

Qt: At a restaurant, each adult meal costs $A and kids eat free. If a group of B people came in an C were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?
