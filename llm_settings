temperature
how random is the output?
how can I get more unpredictable and creative results? high temperature
how can I get more common and conservative output/results? low temperature

what is top p?
what is nucleus sampling?

how can I control the randomness of language model output?
how can I set a threshold probability for answers?
how can I control the degree of randomness and diversity in the generated text?

high temperature/top p -> more unpredictable and interesting - more errors
low temperature/top -> more conservative/predictable - repetitive/uninteresting

are we generating text?
does this task require accuracy?

how can we improve accuracy and factual correctness?

how do hyperparameters affect model output?
